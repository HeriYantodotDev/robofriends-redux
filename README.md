#Robofriends App

Here's the [live link](https://robofriends.heriyanto.dev).
This simple React App renders several cards containing random images, names, and emails. I created this app with the help of the Udemy Course: [“The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Master”](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

And here's the original source: [Andre RoboFriends](https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends).

I extended several things like:
* 🔵 A function to generate an array consisting of robot profiles. The function has a parameter for the number of profiles we’d like to generate,
* 🔵 A function to check the maximum number of robot profiles what we like to render (error pop up & clear the input field),
* 🔵 An input component consists of a text input and a button,
* 🔵 A component to be rendered if no robot found.
